By some stroke of luck, you've made your way here. The Ploopy Mouse. Your life will never be the same.

This repository contains all of the design and production files necessary to make a Ploopy Mouse. We've also included some kick-ass documentation in the Wiki on how to get it made, assemble it, and program it.

What are you waiting for? Your new life awaits.

## QMK?!

Kits bought from the [Ploopy store](https://ploopy.co/product-category/mouse/) come with QMK preloaded. Check out the Wiki for instructions on how to load new firmware onto your device. (It's super easy!)

The firmware hex file that ships with all Mice is included in this repository as well, as `ploopyco_mouse_via.hex`. The hex was built with QMK version 0.11.1.
